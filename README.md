## :bookmark_tabs: Resume of application
"Yellow Square Game" it's a game developed by my own. I learned and studied about JavaScript and decided to try. In this game I used arrays and physics to create some gravity. You can jump for 3 three times before lose the jump. If you fall on the floor or hit something, your jumps come back to start. I loved this experience!
