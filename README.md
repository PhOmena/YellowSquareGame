<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This game have been developed because I always liked to play video-games, then I learned a little more about JavaScript and decided to try. In this game I used arrays and physics to create some gravity. You can jump for 3 three times before lose the jump. If you fall on the floor, your jumps come back to start. I loved this experience!</p>
